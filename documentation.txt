1. start the server in the console with $ npm run start
2. visit http://localhost:3000/api/images in your preferred browser (make sure to turn of ad block)
3. enter url paramters of format http://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=&width=&height=
    a) filenames need to be taken from given pictures from folder ./images/full you can also upload your own .jpg 
4. processed image can be found in the browser, console.log statement will tell if the thumbnail is a new one or is already in cache
5. should give an error message when there is an incorrect filename on the console
6. test can be run with $ npm run test (there is only one small test)
7. scripts to run the code: "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon src/index.ts",
    "log": "npm run build && node build/index.js",
    "jasmine": "jasmine",
    "build": "npx tsc",
    "test": "npm run build && npm run jasmine"
  }
steps taken in writing this code:

- initialized typescript
- installed and configured neccessary packages:
    - express (server)
    - nodemon (auto restarts server on every change)
    - jasmine (unit testing)
    - sharp (image processing)
    - eslint (linting)
    - prettier (code formatting)
    - supertest (endpoint testing)
- written neccessary scripts in package.json 
- git version control
- set up a server
- added routing 
- unit testing with jasmine
- code logic for processing the image
